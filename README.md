## 3 projects of university course.

Project A – Moving Shapes: assemble sets of colorful 3D shapes (per-vertex colors) and 3D transforms for jointed objects that move smoothly and respond to mouse and keyboard.

Project B –3D Views & Shading: Extend transforms with quaternions for rotation, a simple overhead light, and steered, moving cameras with 3D perspective to tour a 3D world.

Project C – Better Lights & Materials: in-depth GLSL: vertex & fragment shaders for realistic surfaces: Gouraud and Phong lighting & shading model, textures, perturbed normals, etc.
